# DankMemer-Farmer
DankMemer Auto-Farm Self-Bot

# Discord Update
After Discord's stupid action of moving to slash commands this impacted DankMemer bot and it moved to slash commands only :D. I had to implement a way to interact with slash commands because Discord.py didn't had this ability yet;<br><br>
Gratitude to issue#07 for providing a hint for indicating a way to trigger slash commands.<br>**This bot now can interact with the new DankMemer commands procedure!**

# FAQ
I'm not responsible if you got **banned**, **since "self-bots"** outside of the OAuth2/bot API is **forbidden**, and can result in account termination if found, **Although Discord didn't take an action against those who broke this term**. See <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-">Discord ToS</a>

# Starting Up
Just run ```bot.py``` and use ```?farm``` to start farming, run with ```True``` parameter for auto-deposit, Duh >w<

### Extra
I apologize (to your eyes) for the retarded code in ```slashCommands.py``` because I don't have the inspiration to make 1 function that handles all commands :D
